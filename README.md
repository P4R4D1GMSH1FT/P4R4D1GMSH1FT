I am currently majoring in philosophy at University of Warsaw. As for philosophy, I am mainly interested in logic (both mathematical and philosophical), as well as in philosophy of mathematics and technology. I am learning how to code mostly for fun, but who knows... GitHub will simply act as my tech journal (and a way to clean my drive from lots of unarranged lines of code) ;)
